CVE-2023-51257 7.8 HIGH Details: An invalid memory write issue in Jasper-Software Jasper v.4.1.1 and before allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2024-0204 Not Yet Rated Details: Authentication bypass in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT prior to 7.4.1 allows an unauthorized user to create an admin user via the administration portal.
CVE-2024-23897 7.5 HIGH Details: Jenkins 2.441 and earlier, LTS 2.426.2 and earlier does not disable a feature of its CLI command parser that replaces an '@' character followed by a file path in an argument with the file's contents, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.
CVE-2024-0741 6.5 MEDIUM Details: An out of bounds write in ANGLE could have allowed an attacker to corrupt memory leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.7, and Thunderbird < 115.7.
CVE-2021-3750 8.2 HIGH Details: A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the USB EHCI controller emulation of QEMU. EHCI does not verify if the Buffer Pointer overlaps with its MMIO region when it transfers the USB packets. Crafted content may be written to the controller's registers and trigger undesirable actions (such as reset) while the device is still transferring packets. This can ultimately lead to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host. This flaw affects QEMU versions before 7.0.0.
